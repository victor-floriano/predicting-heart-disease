# Machine Learning for Business Analytics - Predicting Heart Disease Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for the academic project on Heart Disease Prediction, which was completed as part of the Machine Learning for Business Analytics course at Questrom. The project was a collaborative effort by AKASH RUDRA, ANDREW TRAPP, MAHIMA MASETTY, TAYLOR LEGGETT, and VICTOR FLORIANO.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project was to analyze the Heart Disease Dataset, which is freely available on Kaggle at [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/heart-disease-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/heart-disease-dataset), and predict which patients are likely to have heart disease. The goal of this analysis was to identify patients at a high risk of heart disease or heart failure and assign them to preventative care and early management, thereby potentially saving lives.

## Project Overview

The project involved the following five main steps:

1. **Data Pre-processing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model.

3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Exploring the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between variables and identifying potential patterns.

4. **Baseline Predictive Model**: Building a baseline predictive model to establish a benchmark for performance evaluation.

5. **Alternative Predictive Models**: Developing seven alternative predictive models to explore different machine learning algorithms and compare their performance.

## Tested Algorithms

The following machine learning algorithms were tested for this project:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Ridge Classification Regression
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5. Reborn Tree
6. Boosting (Decision Tree)
7. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Programming Language and Libraries

The entire project was implemented in Python, and the following libraries were used:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (sklearn)
- statsmodels.api

## File Structure

- `predicting_heart_disease_main.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the main project code, including data pre-processing, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and model development.

## How to Use

To run the project and reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
   ```

2. Open the `predicting_heart_disease_main.ipynb.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to execute the code and explore the project.

3. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed by running:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
   ```

4. Load the Heart Disease Dataset located at [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/heart-disease-dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/heart-disease-dataset directory).

5. Follow the code and comments in the notebook to understand the analysis process and the results obtained.
